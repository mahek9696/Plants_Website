		Plants make up an essential part of our natural ecosystems and form a crucial part of any food chain. As they soak up energy from the sun, they grow and serve as food for humans and animals alike. Apart from that, they also provide shelter for a range of organisms. If you’re a plant lover, you’ll love the plant quotes we’ve compiled here if you're a plant lover.

In some Native languages the term for plants translates to  <br> “ those who take care of us.”

	Just as you nourish your body to grow, plants also need this to sustain life. Many plants also provide essential fruit, vegetables, and grains essential to our diets. In this section, you’ll find plant quotes about life and living.

			    "The best time to plant a tree was 25 years ago. The second-best time to plant a tree is today."

<h2> ~ Eliud Kipchoge</h2>

	Researchers have conducted various studies to understand the benefits of bringing plants indoors3. If you already keep indoor plants, you’re probably already a fan of the benefits your plants provide. 
	<br>
	One of the major contributions plants provide is cleaning the air. Basic Biology teaches us that plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This oxygen is essential to our survival. 
	<br>
	Apart from this essential role, plants also influence our overall well-being. A study revealed that indoor plants positively affect the human autonomic nervous system. The plants have this effect by suppressing sympathetic activity1.
